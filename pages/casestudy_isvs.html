<h1>Cloud Sizing Solutions</h1>
<p>Significant part of the infrastructure spend in either private or public cloud is wasted due to various reasons such as (i) wrongly sized infrastructure owing to lack of performance data or sized purely based on peak considerations (ii) unused VMs or zombie VMs (iii) wrong over-provisioning ratios (iv) wrong choice of storage etc. MapleLabs suite of solutions helps users get a better visibility into their workloads, right-size the infrastructure and optimize their data centers and hybrid cloud environments.</p>
